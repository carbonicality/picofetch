# picofetch
picofetch is a neofetch-like utility, that i created for the picoducky Hack Club YSWS, where plugging in the picoducky should open up a custom neofetch-like terminal output!

it has information about the computer, and the picoducky itself!

please keep in mind that as of right now, this program only works for Linux. i programmed this on Arch Linux, so it will probably work best on that.
